abstract: Intraosseous (IO) access is frequently utilized during the resuscitation
  of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. Due to proximity to the heart
  and differential flow rates, the anatomical site of IO access may impact patient
  outcomes. Using a large dataset, we aimed to compare the outcomes of OHCA patients
  who received upper or lower extremity IO access during resuscitation. The ESO Data
  Collaborative public use research datasets were used for this retrospective study.
  All adult (â‰¥18 years of age) OHCA patients with successful IO access in an upper
  or lower extremity were evaluated for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they
  had intravenous (IV) access prior to IO access, or if they had a Do Not Resuscitate
  order documented. Our primary outcome was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).
  Secondary outcomes included survival to discharge and survival to discharge to home.
  Mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, etiology,
  witnessed status, pre-first responder cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), initial
  electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm, location [private/residential, public, or assisted
  living/institutional], and response time in addition to the primary airway management
  strategy (endotracheal intubation, supraglottic device, surgical airway, no advanced
  airway) were used to compare the outcomes of patients with upper extremity IO access
  to the outcomes of patients with lower extremity IO access. After application of
  exclusion criteria, 155,884 patients who received IO access during resuscitation
  remained (76% lower extremity, 24% upper extremity). Upper extremity IO access was
  associated with greater adjusted odds of ROSC (1.11 [1.08, 1.15]), and this finding
  was consistent across multiple patient subgroups. Secondary analyses suggested that
  upper extremity access was associated with increased survival to discharge (1.18
  [1.00, 1.39]) and survival to discharge to home (1.23 [1.02, 1.48]) in comparison
  to lower extremity IO access. In this large prehospital dataset, upper extremity
  IO access was associated with a small increase in the odds of ROSC in comparison
  to lower extremity IO access. These data support the need for prospective investigation
  of the ideal IO access site during OHCA resuscitation.
