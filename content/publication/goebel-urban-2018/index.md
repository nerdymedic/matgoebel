abstract: 'AbstractBackground: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used with
  increasing frequency and left in place for longer periods of time. Prior publications
  have focused on the mechanics of troubleshooting the device itself. We aim to describe
  the epidemiology of LVAD patient presentations to emergency medical services (EMS),
  prehospital assessments and interventions, and hospital outcomes.Methods: This is
  a retrospective chart review of known LVAD patients belonging to a single academic
  center’s heart failure program who activated the 9-1-1 system and were transported
  by an urban EMS system to one of the center’s two emergency departments between
  January 2012 and December 2015. Identifying demographics were used to query the
  electronic medical record of the responding city fire agency and contracted transporting
  ambulance service. Two reviewers abstracted prehospital chief complaint, vital signs,
  assessments, and interventions. Emergency department and hospital outcomes were
  retrieved separately.Resul...'
