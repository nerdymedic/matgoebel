abstract: 'Introduction: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a time-sensitive
  entity that has been shown to benefit from prehospital diagnosis by electrocardiogram
  (ECG). Current computer algorithms with binary decision making are not accurate
  enough to be relied on for cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation. Hypothesis:
  An algorithmic approach is proposed to stratify binary STEMI computerized ECG interpretations
  into low, intermediate, and high STEMI probability tiers. Methods: Based on previous
  literature, a four-criteria algorithm was developed to rule out/in common causes
  of prehospital STEMI false-positive computer interpretations: heart rate, QRS width,
  ST elevation criteria, and artifact. Prehospital STEMI cases were prospectively
  collected at a single academic center in Salt Lake City, Utah (USA) from May 2012
  through October 2013. The prehospital ECGs were applied to the algorithm and compared
  against activation of the CCL by an emergency department (ED) physician as the outcome
  of interest. In addition to calculating test characteristics, linear regression
  was used to look for an association between number of criteria used and accuracy,
  and logistic regression was used to test if any single criterion performed better
  than another. Results: There were 63 ECGs available for review, 39 high probability
  and 24 intermediate probability. The high probability STEMI tier had excellent test
  characteristics for ruling in STEMI when all four criteria were used, specificity
  1.00 (95% CI, 0.59-1.00), positive predictive value 1.00 (0.91-1.00). Linear regression
  showed a strong correlation demonstrating that false-positives increased as fewer
  criteria were used (adjusted r-square 0.51; P textless.01). Logistic regression
  showed no significant predictive value for any one criterion over another (P = .80).
  Limiting physician overread to the intermediate tier only would reduce the number
  of ECGs requiring physician overread by a factor of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.48-0.75; P textless.01).
  Conclusion: Prehospital STEMI ECGs can be accurately stratified to high, intermediate,
  and low probabilities for STEMI using the four criteria. While additional study
  is required, using this tiered algorithmic approach in prehospital ECGs could lead
  to changes in CCL activation and decreased requirements for physician overread.
  This may have significant clinical and quality implications.'
