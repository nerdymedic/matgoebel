abstract: Certain acute coronary syndrome electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns, which
  do not include ST-segment elevation, are indicative of acute coronary syndrome caused
  by significant arterial occlusion; these patterns are, of course, associated with
  significant risk to the patient and mandate a rapid response from the health care
  team. One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T
  wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial
  leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated
  with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case
  of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to
  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall.
