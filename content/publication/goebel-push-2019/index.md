abstract: 'Introduction: Prehospital acquisition of electrocardiograms (ECG) has been
  consistently associated with reduced door-to-balloon times in the treatment of ST-segment
  myocardial infarction (STEMI). There is little evidence establishing best hospital
  practices once the ECG has been received by the emergency department (ED). This
  study evaluates the use of a push notification system to reduce delays in cardiac
  catheterization lab (CCL) activation for prehospital STEMI. Methods: In this prospective
  before-and-after study, we collected prehospital ECGs with computer interpretation
  of STEMI from May 2012 to October 2013. Push notifications were implemented June
  1, 2013. During the study period, we collected timestamps of when the prehospital
  ECG was received (email timestamp of receiving account), CCL team activation (timestamp
  in paging system), and patient arrival (timestamp in ED tracking board). When prehospital
  ECGs were received in the ED, an audible alert was played via the Vocera WiFi communication
  system, notifying nursing staff that an ECG was available for physician interpretation.
  We compared the time from receiving the ECG to activation of the CCL before and
  after the audible notification was implemented. Results: Of the 56 cases received,
  we included 45 in our analysis (20 cases with pre-arrival CCL activation and 25
  with post-arrival activation). For the pre-arrival group, the interval from ECG
  received to CCL activation prior to implementation was 9.1 minutes with a standard
  deviation (SD) of 5.7 minutes. After implementation, the interval was reduced to
  3.33 minutes with a SD of 1.63 minutes. Delay was decreased by 5.8 minutes (p textless
  0.01). Post-implementation activation times were more consistent, demonstrated by
  a decrease in SD from 5.75 to 1.63 min (p textless 0.01). For patients with CCL
  activation after arrival, there was no significant change in mean delay after implementation.
  Conclusion: In this small, single-center observational study, we demonstrated that
  the use of push notifications to ED staff alerting that a prehospital STEMI ECG
  was received correlated with a small reduction in, and increased consistency of,
  ED CCL activation.'
