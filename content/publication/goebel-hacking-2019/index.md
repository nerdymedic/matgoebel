abstract: '9-1-1 call centers are a critical component of prehospital care: they accept
  emergency calls, dispatch field responders such as emergency medical services, and
  provide callers with emergency medical instructions before their arrival. The aim
  of this study was to describe the technical structure of the 9-1-1 call-taking system
  and to describe its vulnerabilities that could lead to compromised patient care.
  9-1-1 calls answered from mobile phones and landlines use a variety of technologies
  to provide information about caller location and other information. These interconnected
  technologies create potential cyber vulnerabilities. A variety of attacks could
  be carried out on 9-1-1 infrastructure to various ends. Attackers could target individuals,
  groups, or entire municipalities. These attacks could result in anything from a
  nuisance to increased loss of life in a physical attack to worse overall outcomes
  owing to delays in care for time-sensitive conditions. Evolving 9-1-1 systems are
  increasingly connected and dependent on network technology. As implications of cybersecurity
  vulnerabilities loom large, future research should examine methods of hardening
  the 9-1-1 system against attack. [J Med Internet Res 2019;21(7):e14383]'
