abstract: "Introduction: San Diego has one of the busiest international land border
  crossings in the world. The epidemiology of prehospital care at the San Diego (California,
  United States) - Tijuana (Baja California, Mexico) border crossings are previously
  unreported. Investigators sought to describe prehospital care provided at the San
  Diego border crossings. Methods: This was a cross-sectional, retrospective data
  collection from April 2014 to March 2017 evaluating prehospital provider (PHP) contacts
  at two international border crossing addresses in San Diego. The 9-1-1 dispatch
  center and first response were provided by a single municipal fire agency with ambulance
  transportation provided by a contracting private agency. Patient dispatch data and
  electronic patient care records were queried for patient demographics, PHP arrival
  time, incident complaint, assessment narrative, and treatments provided. Natural
  language processing techniques were applied to map the narrative to the National
  Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System. Descriptive analysis was
  performed in the R software program. Results: A total of 6,261 PHP patient contacts
  were made at the two border crossings during the study period. 87% of the calls
  were at the San Ysidro border crossing compared to 13% at Otay Mesa. The population,
  composed of 50.8% males, had ages ranging from 0 days - 103 years old, with a median
  age of 45 years old. There were 606 (9.7%) pediatric patients (textless18 years)
  and 1,416 (22.6%) geriatric patients (textgreater65 years). The top three incident
  complaints were respiratory distress (830, 10.8%) blunt trauma (827, 10.7%) and
  abdominal pain (814, 10.6%), and the top 3 medications provided were oxygen (481,
  7.7%), normal saline (393, 6.3%) and ondansetron (352, 5.6%). Conclusion: This was
  the first study of PHP assessment and care at the San Diego-Tijuana border crossings.
  We found a large diversity in patient ages. Respiratory distress and blunt trauma
  were the most frequent complaints and oxygen was the most frequent treatment. The
  busiest day of the week was Sunday, and the busiest month of the year was July.
  Our newly described findings may assist EMS agencies with optimizing staff, equipment,
  and training at international border crossings."
