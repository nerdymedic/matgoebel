abstract: BACKGROUND A significant increase in false positive ST-elevation myocardial
  infarction (STEMI) electrocardiogram interpretations was noted after replacement
  of all of the City of San Diego's 110 monitor-defibrillator units with a new brand.
  These concerns were brought to the manufacturer and a revised interpretive algorithm
  was implemented. OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the effects of a revised interpretation
  algorithm to identify STEMI when used by San Diego paramedics. METHODS Data were
  reviewed 6 months before and 6 months after the introduction of a revised interpretation
  algorithm. True-positive and false-positive interpretations were identified. Factors
  contributing to an incorrect interpretation were assessed and patient demographics
  were collected. RESULTS A total of 372 (234 preimplementation, 138 postimplementation)
  cases met inclusion criteria. There was a significant reduction in false positive
  STEMI (150 preimplementation, 40 postimplementation; p textless 0.001) after implementation.
  The most common factors resulting in false positive before implementation were right
  bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation. The new
  algorithm corrected for these misinterpretations with most postimplementation false
  positives attributed to benign early repolarization and poor data quality. Subsequent
  follow-up at 10 months showed maintenance of the observed reduction in false positives.
  CONCLUSIONS This study shows that introducing a revised 12-lead interpretive algorithm
  resulted in a significant reduction in the number of false positive STEMI electrocardiogram
  interpretations in a large urban emergency medical services system. Rigorous testing
  and standardization of new interpretative software is recommended before introduction
  into a clinical setting to prevent issues resulting from inappropriate cardiac catheterization
  laboratory activations.
